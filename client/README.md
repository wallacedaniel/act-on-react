# Act-On Software React Coding Challenge

Hi Team,

Thanks for your consideration for the role!

To launch the express server cd into the root directory and enter - npm run server
To launch the React app cd into the client folder and enter - yarn start

I've included the Context API, using the useState and useEffect hooks. I've written the project using ES6.

For time's sake I've left a final obstacle unsolved, which I would be happy to learn more about. The app functions as expected. However, the initial state is still being derived from the table data contained in the client folder when creating the context, rather than from the server. Without this, the app fails to compile. The app immediately re renders on the initial load, as the data is properly fetched and applied to state. So, state in the app is ultimately based on the server model, but still needs the client model present to compile.  

The code relevant to that obstacle is contained within context/tables/tables.context.js and components/tab/tab.component.js if you have any further thoughts on this.

Feel free to reach out to me at my email daniel.wallace@act-on.com or Slack me with any questions.

Thanks!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
